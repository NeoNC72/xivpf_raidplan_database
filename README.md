# XIV PF Raid Plan Aggregator

This project fetches raid plan links (from raidplan.io, pastebin.com, and ff14.toolboxgaming.space) mentioned in Final Fantasy XIV Party Finder listings for high-end duties via the xivpf.com API. It stores these links in an SQLite database and provides a simple web interface to view the collected plans, grouped by duty name. I hate seeing pf use last 3 letters of the url and the url not being anywhere online when seraching of it so hopefuly this will have them after some time.
